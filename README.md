# Ecommerce_dashboard

üîç Excited to share my recent project! üöÄ

I had the opportunity to develop a comprehensive sales dashboard for Madhav Ecommerce, providing actionable insights for the team. Here are some key highlights of the dashboard:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Showcased critical metrics like total revenue, number of orders, and customer acquisition costs‚Äîallowing the team to track performance at a glance.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Data Visualization: Leveraged bar graphs, pie charts, and line graphs to transform complex data into clear, easy-to-understand visuals, empowering data-driven decisions.

3Ô∏è‚É£ In-depth Data Segmentation: Analyzed sales data by state, payment mode, quarter, and sub-category to support strategic decision-making.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Efficient Data Handling: Managed large datasets, including customer names and their associated revenue figures, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the data.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Enhanced Interpretability: Implemented color coding to differentiate data points, improving the clarity and usability of the dashboard.
